# ABM Reservoir Management and Optimization
This project uses an Agent-Based Model to simulate and optimize reservoir management, focusing on production rates and pressure dynamics.

## Parameters
- `pressure`: Reservoir pressure for each well (psi)
- `production_rate`: Production rate (bbl/day)
- `porosity`: Reservoir porosity
